# magnolia
- import example data from magnolia/_dev/website.astro-minimal.xml

# Frontend (spa/astro-test)
- yarn install
- yarn dev

# Missing
New pages and pages layout are not correctly handled for now. There's only one page template, no mapping for the page level

# Improvements
Use an other method instead of attributes to send the data, it pollutes the DOM too much
